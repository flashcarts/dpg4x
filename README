1. INTRODUCTION

Dpg4x is a program that tries to make the DPG video creation as easy as possible
on Linux. Since version 2.0 it also runs on Windows and OS X.

If you are reading this, I suppose you already know what a DPG video is, so I'll
be brief. A DPG video is the video format that you need if you want to play
movies on your Nintendo DS.

Dpg4x relies on mplayer/mencoder to do it's work, so any video file playable
with mplayer can be converted to DPG. Check the INSTALL file for more details
about dependencies and installation.


2. FEATURES

- Simple GUI suitable for beginners.
- Includes lots of options for the advanced user.
- Supports individual per-media settings when needed.
- Multiple DPG version support, from DPG0 to DPG4.
- Can process any video file playable by mplayer.
- Encodes your DVD and VCD directly.
- Includes subtitles support.
- Ability to preview the encoding settings.
- Drag and drop support from your favourite file manager.
- Batch processing.
- Multiplatform.
- Multilanguage.
- The dpg2avi script can convert DPG files to AVI format.


3. USAGE

3.1. Media Sources List

If you run dpg4x, the first thing that you will see is the MAIN section. You can
switch from one section to another with the icon-buttons at the top.

The MAIN section includes a list, with all the media sources that you want to
encode. To add a media source to the list, use the "Add Media" button. This will
enable the "Add File", "Add DVD" and "Add VCD" buttons. To delete a media source
from the list, select the media and use the "Delete Media" button. 

To add a file, just browse your file system and select it. To add a DVD or a VCD
you need to select the track and the disc reader device. When adding a DVD, you
can filter by a range of chapters.

Need more? Now you can also add files with drag-and-drop from your favourite
file manager!

3.2. Start Encoding

When you have completed the list, just use the "Start Encoding" button. If you
want to setup the options for the encoding, you can select the DPG Version and
the quality that you want to use. The DPG videos will be stored in the same
folder as the original video files, but you can change this behaviour in the
MISC section. This is a must when you are using DVD or VCD sources.

3.3. Preview Modes

With the "Play Media" and "DPG Preview" buttons at the MAIN section you can
play the media sources before encoding.

However, they work in a different way, while on the one hand "Play Media" just
plays the media source "as is" using mplayer, the "DPG Preview" button encodes
the beginning of the video, using the encoding settings you have selected, and
then plays it as a DPG-like video. This is specially useful for testing your
settings and seeing how your video would like. You can setup the length of the
preview from the MISC section.

3.4. Default Settings

When you need to adjust the encoding process to your needs, dpg4x offers two
ways to configure it.

If you want your settings to be applied to all the videos you encode, you just
need to switch to another section and adjust the default settings. Remember that
all the sections are always available via the icon-buttons at the top.

The VIDEO section includes advanced video options. e.g. You can change the video
bitrate, and the FPS. In the AUDIO section you can select the audio track to
encode and adjust the audio quality. The SUBTITLES section includes all the
options you need to add subtitles to the videos, and the MISC section includes
the options that didn't fit in the other sections, like the tmp folder that
dpg4x uses.

3.5. Individual Settings

If you want to set default settings for only one video (e.g. you may want to set
a specific thumbnail or subtitles file), you can select the media source and
press the "Set" button in the "Individual Settings" menu, at the bottom-right of
the MAIN section. A popup window will be opened, showing the same options
available in the default configuration sections, just perform the changes and
press save. The default settings will no longer be used for that media source,
only the settings you just set.

You can press "Set" again to perform another change or press "Delete" to delete
the individual configuration for that media source. If you are not sure about
if a media source will use individual or default settings you can check it in
the media sources list, in the MAIN section (second column).

3.6. Default Subtitles

If you have problems when adding subtitles to your videos, just include a
subtitles file in the folder where the original video file is. The name of the
subtitles file must be the same as the video file, except the extension. To
check that everything is ok, just play the video file with mplayer (e.g. with
the "Preview" button). As the last step, don't forget to switch to the SUBTITLES
section and select "Auto" as the subtitles source.


4. DPG2AVI

You can encode the DPG video files to AVI format with the dpg2avi script. To use
the dpg2avi script, just set the DPG and AVI files as parameters. For example:
dpg2avi input_file.dpg output_file.avi

The dpg2avi script does not re-enconde the video or the audio streams in the DPG
file. It only performs changes in the container, so all the properties like
framerate, video size, bitrates, quality, etc. will be the same.


5. CONFIGURATION

When you use dpg4x, it stores the current configuration in your home folder. The
full path of the configuration directory is:
~/.config/dpg4x/

The next time dpg4x is opened, it will restore the last saved configuration. You
can delete the configuration files to reset the default or the individual media
settings. But you should not edit the configuration file by hand. The default
settings are stored in a file named config.ini

You can also reset all the configuration to the default values by pressing the
"Reset to default" button in the MISC section.

The dpg2avi does not read the dpg4x configuration files. It stores the temporary
files in the output directory.
