NOTE: This file only includes information that is specific for OS X, please
refer to the INSTALL file for general information about installing dpg4x.


To get dpg4x up and running on MacOSX you will need to install the
following dependencies:

a. Python 2.6.1 and wxPython 2.8.8.1 are preinstalled on MacOSX 10.6.4 while
Python 2.5.1 and wxPython 2.8.4.0 are preinstalled on MacOSX 10.5.8 so nothing
needs to be done with these.

b. Getting mencoder installed is the tricky bit. There are several Mac binaries
available for mplayer (not mencoder) but most are quite dated and do not work
properly with dpg4x. So I tested the Mac Fink version of mplayer and mencoder.

c. Fink installs some items from precompiled binary packages but most items are
compiled from source. Fortunately, this does not matter all that much since Fink
does the heavy lifting either way. You need to install Xcode Tools from Apple
which is a rather large and time consuming install but the package is free and
may come in handy for other things in the future.

d. Once Xcode is installed follow the instructions on this page
http://www.finkproject.org/download/srcdist.php to install Fink on 10.6 or 10.5,
also a large and time consuming process. Between Xcode and Fink you'll need
about 4-5GB of disk space just to compile mplayer and mencoder on your system.
Unless you can find a fairly new binary version (1.0rc2-4.2.1) of mplayer and
mencoder some where.

e. Do all the install steps listed but add the following commands to install
mplayer (mencoder is a part of the same install). Unfortunately, mplayer is
considered an unstable package which requires a few extra steps.
ea. vi /sw/etc/fink.conf
eb. Make sure the Trees: line reads like the following: Trees: local/main
stable/main stable/crypto unstable/main unstable/crypto
ec. fink selfupdate-cvs
ed. fink index -f
ee. fink install mplayer

f. Download essential-macosx-x86-20060611.zip from
http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/ unzip, install, and then run:
ln -s /usr/local/lib/codecs /sw/lib/codecs

g. Install dpg4x and run as you would on Linux. Read the INSTALL file for more
details.
