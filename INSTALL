DEPENDENCIES

dpg4x needs the following packages to be available on your system. Also note
that all the dependent programs must be accesible via the PATH.

python (2.5)
python-wxversion (2.8)
python-wxgtk (2.8)
mplayer (1:1.0)
mencoder (1:1.0)

Versions in brackets include those that dpg4x has been tested with, but others 
may work too.

The following packages are not mandatory, but dpg4x can take advantage of them,
when they are present. If we were talking about packages, these are the packages
that the dpg4x package would recommend.

mpeg_stat (2.2) - provides a faster and more tested way of generating headers.
iconv (2.9) - necessary if you want to change the encoding for subtitles.

If you can't find mpeg_stat for your system, try this URL:
http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/multimedia/Berkeley/mpeg/stat/


NINTENDO DS COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE

The current version of dpg4x, has been tested with MoonShell 2.06. Older versions
are supposed to work too, if you select the apropiate DPG version for your
videos.

Videos encoded with dpg4x are known to work in other alternative DPG players, as
those included with M3-DS cards, for example. To ensure better compatibility,
it is recomended to encode your videos as DPG0 version, and to keep your DPG
player as updated as possible.


INSTALLATION

Since dpg4x is written in python, you only need to extract the source folder
anywhere on your system. Then, execute the dpg4x script and enjoy.

If the program does not start, run it from a console and check the output.


CUSTOMIZING THE INSTALLATION

You can use different paths for every file type included with dpg4x. This may
be usefull, e.g. if you want to create a software package for your Linux
distribution.

In order to enable this feature, you just need to edit the dpg4x file. This file
is an executable shell script, and declares the following variables:

DPG4X_SOURCE. Path to the dpg4x sorce (.py, .pyc) files.
DPG4X_ICONS. Path to the icon files.
DPG4X_I18N. Path to the gettext resources.

The programs that dpg4x wraps (mplayer, mencoder, mpeg_stat and iconv) are
accesed via the PATH variable. You can also select the python interpreter to
use, as it is specified in the last line of the script.

Note that the dpg4x script file itself, should be included in your system's
PATH, in order to be accesible. 

If you want to include an entry for dpg4x in your menu, you can use the icon
files named dpg4x_XX.png. Just an idea: you may link them as standart icon
resources in /usr/share/icons...
