INTRODUCTION

dpg4x is a program that tries to make the DPG video creation as easy as posible
on Linux.

If you are reading this, I supose you already know what a DPG video is, so I'll
be brief. A DPG video is the video format that you need if you want to play movies
in your Nintendo DS.

dpg4x relies on mplayer/mencoder to do it's work, so any video file playable with
mplayer can be converted to DPG. Check the INSTALL file for more details about
dependencies and installation.


FEATURES

- Simple GUI suitable for beginners.
- It also includes a lots of options for the advanced user.
- Multiple DPG version support, from DPG0 to DPG4.
- Can process any video file playable by mplayer.
- Drag and drop support from your favourite file manager.
- Easily portable to any POSIX like OS.
- Multilanguage.
- Subtitles support.
- Ability to preview the encoding settings.
- Encode your DVD and VCD directly.
- Batch processing.


USAGE

If you run dpg4x, the first thing that you will see is the MAIN section. You can
switch from one section to another with the icon-buttons at the top.

The MAIN section includes a list, with all the media sources that you want to
encode. To add a media source to the list, use the "Add Media" button. This will
enable the "Add File", "Add DVD" and "Add VCD" buttons. To delete a media source
from the list, select the media and use the "Delete Media" button. You can also
play the madia sources and preview the encoding settings.

To add a file, just browse your file system and select it. To add a DVD or a VCD
you need to select the track and the disc reader device. When adding a DVD, you
can filter by a range of chapters.

Need more? Now you can also add files with drag-and-drop from your favourite file
manager!

When you have completed the list, just use the "Start Encoding" button. If you
want to setup the options for the encoding, you can select the DPG Version and
the quality that you want to use. The DPG videos will be stored in the same
folder than the original video files, but you can change this behaviour in the
MISC section. This is a must when you are using DVD or VCD sources.

For advanced setup, you can switch to another section. Remember that all the
sections are always available via the icon-buttons at the top.

The VIDEO section includes advanced video options. e.g. You can change the video
bitrate, and the FPS. In the AUDIO section you can select the audio track to
encode and adjust the audio quality. The SUBTITLES section includes all the
options you need to add subtitles to the videos, and the MISC section includes
the options that didn't fit in the other sections, like the tmp folder that
dpg4x uses.

If you have problems when adding subtitles to your videos, just include a
subtitles file in the folder where the original video file is. The name of the
subtitles file must be the same as the video file, except the extension. To
check that everything is ok, just play the video file with mplayer (e.g. with
the "Preview" button). As the last step, don't forget to switch to the SUBTITLES
section and select "Auto" as the subtitles source.


CONFIGURATION

When you use dpg4x, it stores the current configuration in your home folder. The
full path of the configuration file is:
~/.config/dpg4x/config.ini

The next time dpg4x is opened, it will restore the last saved configuration. You
can delete the configuration file to reset to the default values again. But you
should not edit the configuration file by hand.
