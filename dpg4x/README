1. INTRODUCTION

Dpg4x is a program that tries to make the DPG video creation as easy as possible
on Linux. Since version 2.0 it also runs on Windows and OS X.

If you are reading this, I suppose you already know what a DPG video is, so I'll
be brief. A DPG video is the video format that you need if you want to play
movies on your Nintendo DS.

Dpg4x relies on mplayer/mencoder to do it's work, so any video file playable
with mplayer can be converted to DPG. Check the INSTALL file for more details
about dependencies and installation.


2. FEATURES

- Simple GUI suitable for beginners.
- Includes lots of options for the advanced user.
- Supports individual per-media settings when needed.
- Multiple DPG version support, from DPG0 to DPG4.
- Can process any video file playable by mplayer.
- Encodes your DVD and VCD directly.
- Includes subtitles support.
- Ability to preview the encoding settings.
- Drag and drop support from your favourite file manager.
- Batch processing.
- Multiplatform.
- Multilanguage.
- The dpg2avi script can convert DPG files to AVI format.
- The dpgimginjector script can replace the thumbnail included in a DPG4 file.
