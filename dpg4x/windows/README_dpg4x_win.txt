This directory contains files for creating a standalone Windows installer for dpg4x.
In addition to the dpg4x files the installer also:
- installs the redistributable Visual C libraries needed by the exe file generated by py2exe
- downloads and installs mplayer from the SourceForge project "MPlayer for Win32" 

NOTE: dpg4x requires mplayer. If you install your own it must either be installed in a directory directly below dpg4x or in %ProgramFiles%. 

Dependencies to create the installer:
========
* Python 2.7: ActivePython-2.7.1.3-win32-x86.msi
* wxPython 2.9: wxPython2.9-win32-2.9.1.1-py27.exe
* py2exe to include Python and wxPython in the installer: py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.7.exe
* NSIS to create the final installer: nsis-2.46-setup.exe
  * 7z for NSIS - http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Nsis7z_plug-in
  * downloader for NSIS - http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in
* Visual C runtime libraries, copied to <top_dir>\windows\dependencies\vcredist_x86.exe
* Optional: Eclipse with the plugins pydev and eclipsensis

How to create the exe file without using Eclipse:
1. Unpack the 2.1 tar file: dpg4x_2.1.tar.bz2
2. Unpack this file, dpg4x_2.1_windows.tgz in the top directory
3. Click on windows\winbuild.bat

Todo:
========
1. A few sentences in nsis_translations need translations to Catalan
2. The NSIS page for choose whether to install for all or current user is not translated into Swedish, Catalan
3. More testing on sub titles and encoding directly from DVDs
4. Test on 64 bit Windows
